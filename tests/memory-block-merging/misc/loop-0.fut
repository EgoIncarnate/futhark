-- Code below should result in 4 successful coalescing
-- operations in the memory block of `y`. These are:
-- (i) @y[n/2] = a1@, (ii) `a1 = implicit-copy(x2)`,
-- (iii) `a1 = inner-loop-a1`, (iv) `a1 = a0`.
-- Note that the coalescing of `x1` in `x2 = copy x1`
-- should FAIL, because its computation requires `a1`,
-- hence `x1` cannot be coalesced in the memory block
-- of `y`, i.e., getting 5 successful coalescing
-- operations would be incorrect! This last memory reuse
-- can potentially be done by linear-scan register
-- allocation later!
