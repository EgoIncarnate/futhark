-- The number of successful coalescing should be 1!
-- The successful coalescing refers to the last
-- statement of the loop `double_mem_buffer = copy(e)`
-- which is invisible and is introduced by the compiler.
-- The rest is negativve testing:
-- The init parameter `y` is not lastly used in the
-- initialization of the loop variant `a`. Hence the
-- coalescing of `a` (and `y`) into the memory block
-- of `w` fails. Also `y'[1]` cannot reuse the space
-- of `w` for obvious reasons (only reshape operations can).
